## Install packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

## Exploratory data analysis with dplyr

### Inspect the data
```{r}
df_planes <- planes
head(df_planes,10)
```
```{r}
df_planes %>%  glimpse()
```
### Rank Total number of planes produced by the manufacturers according to their type after the 2000.
```{r}
df_planes %>% filter(year >= 2000) %>% group_by(manufacturer) %>% count(type) %>% arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  mutate(number_of_planes=n)
```
### Find the years that the total number of seats in the planes produced by AIRBUS is more than BOEING

```{r}
AIRBUS_seat_number<-df_planes %>% filter(manufacturer=="AIRBUS") %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(total_number_of_seats=sum(seats))
BOEING_seat_number<-df_planes %>% filter(manufacturer=="BOEING") %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(total_number_of_seats=sum(seats))
AIRBUS_seat_number$year[AIRBUS_seat_number$total_number_of_seats>BOEING_seat_number$total_number_of_seats]
```
